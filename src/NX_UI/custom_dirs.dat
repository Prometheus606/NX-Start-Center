#  This file is used to specify directories which will be searched for
#  menu files, toolbar files, dialog files or UDO libraries.  The directories
#  added here may or may not exist, to allow the same file to be used at 
#  multiple sites.  When Unigraphics starts up, it will check each entry, if
#  the directory does not exist, the line will be discarded as if it was a 
#  comment.  Comments are allowed, and must start with a # in column one.  
#
#  Directories must be listed one per line, with nothing else on the line.  The 
#  directory may include environment variables, by specifying $variable.  If 
#  a $ is needed in a directory, it may be specified using $$, e.g. 
#  /users/my$$ would be the directory /users/my$.  The file may be made to 
#  work on UNX or WNT, on WNT any / characters will be replaced by \.  
#
#  A #include construct is supported to include other files, to make it easier 
#  for individual users to customize their runtime environment.  Finally the 
#  location of this file is controlled by the environment variable 
#  $UGII_CUSTOM_DIRECTORY_FILE which by default points to 
#  $UGII_DEFAULT_MENU_DIR/custom_dirs.dat.  Customers with a number of 
#  customizations, or a number of third party products have two ways to set
#  this up:
#    1.  This is the preferred method.  Create a file on a network drive 
#    that has lists all of the directories of the customizations.  Then the 
#    environment variable UGII_CUSTOM_DIRECTORY_FILE can point to this shared 
#    file, so that all users will load the third party software.  When a new
#    software tool needs to be added in, the global shared file can be updated
#    to give all users access to the new software.
#
#    2.  Edit this file and add the directory to it.  The problem with doing
#    this is that different users will have local copies of the NX software,
#    and so different files that need to be kept up-to-date.
#
#  Customers should feel free to edit this file.
